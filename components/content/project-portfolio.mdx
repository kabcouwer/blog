This site is built with NextJS for its static site generation and better performance. Tailwind CSS
is utilized for its class library, customablity, and fast development and MDX provides a more
intuitive blogging experience. I chose to learn Typescript with this project becuase of its popularity
and maintainability over Javascript.
