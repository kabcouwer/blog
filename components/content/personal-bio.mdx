I am an experienced **software engineer** and an adept **problem solver**
who is looking to learn and use my skills to help create a more sustainable and kinder
future. For that reason, I am actively looking for my next position in the **clean** or
**civic tech** space.

<br></br>I am proficient in **Ruby on Rails**, **PHP**, and **SQL**. My previous
experience has been more backend focused, so I decided to strengthen my frontend
skills with the development of this website. I hope you like it!
