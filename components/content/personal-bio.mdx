I am an experienced <span className="text-red">**software engineer**</span> and an adept
<span className="text-red">**problem solver**</span> who is looking to learn and
use my skills to help create a more sustainable and kinder future. For that reason,
I am actively looking for my next position in the <span className="text-yellow">**clean**</span> or
<span className="text-yellow">**civic tech**</span> space.

<br></br>

I am proficient in <span className="text-blue">**Ruby on Rails**</span>, 
<span className="text-blue">**PHP**</span>, and <span className="text-blue">**SQL**</span>. 
My previous experience has been more backend focused, so I decided to strengthen
my frontend skills with the development of this website. I hope you like it!
