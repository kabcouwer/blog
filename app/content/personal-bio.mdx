I am an experienced software engineer who is looking to learn and
use my skills to help create a more sustainable and kinder future.
For that reason, I am actively looking for my next position in the
clean or civic tech space.

I'm passionate about many creative pursuits, including music,
home renovation, woodworking, and of course, coding. This combination
of interests and my passion for problem solving is what ultimately led
me to my career in software development.
