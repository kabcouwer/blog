As an experienced software engineer, I have acquired an array of skills that I am eager 
to utilize in a meaningful way to contribute to a more sustainable and compassionate 
future. My current goal is to secure a position within the clean or civic tech 
industry where I can make a positive impact.

Aside from software development, I have a deep passion for various creative outlets 
including music, home renovation, woodworking, and problem-solving. These interests 
have served as a natural complement to my career in software development, allowing me 
to approach challenges with a unique and holistic perspective.

Overall, I strive to leverage my experience and passions to create meaningful solutions 
and make a difference in the world.
