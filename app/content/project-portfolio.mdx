This site leverages NextJS to implement static site generation, ensuring fast and 
reliable website performance. To enhance the website's user interface, I incorporated Tailwind 
CSS, which offers a comprehensive library of pre-designed classes that expedited the development 
process. I also utilized MDX, which allowed me to add dynamic interactivity and embed components 
within the content, thereby increasing the site's overall functionality.

This project was particularly meaningful to me since my career has primarily focused on back-end 
development. By honing my front-end skills, I expanded my knowledge base and became a more 
well-rounded developer, capable of tackling complex projects from both a back-end and front-end 
perspective.
