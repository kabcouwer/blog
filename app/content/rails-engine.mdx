An E-commerce Rails API responsible for providing data on merchants, items, invoices, and 
more to be utilized by a front-end interface. The application employs advanced ActiveRecord 
queries to analyze the data stored in a SQL database, allowing for efficient data retrieval 
and manipulation.

By implementing advanced data analysis techniques, the application delivers a seamless user 
experience while maintaining the highest standards of data accuracy and reliability. Overall, 
this project highlights my ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to build robust, 
high-performance applications that meet complex business needs.
