Market Money is a powerful Rails Rest API that delivers robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
functionality for managing markets and vendors. To ensure that the API functions seamlessly, 
I incorporated RSpec as the testing framework and Faker to generate realistic, fake data. These 
measures helped to verify the functionality of endpoints and minimize the potential for errors.

To provide additional value to users, the API incorporates JSON Serialization, ensuring fast and 
efficient data transfer. Additionally, the API's thorough error handling capabilities minimize the 
risk of downtime or data loss, ensuring that users can rely on the API to manage their market and 
vendor data with confidence.
